## Nix 2.28.6 Reference Manual

Warning This program is experimental and its interface is subject to change.

## Name

nix daemon - daemon to perform store operations on behalf of non-root clients

## Synopsis

nix daemon [option...]

## Examples

Run the daemon: # nix daemon Run the daemon and listen on standard I/O instead of binding to a UNIX socket: # nix daemon --stdio Run the daemon and force all connections to be trusted: # nix daemon --force-trusted Run the daemon and force all connections to be untrusted: # nix daemon --force-untrusted Run the daemon, listen on standard I/O, and force all connections to use Nix's default trust: # nix daemon --stdio --default-trust

## Description

This command runs the Nix daemon, which is a required component in multi-user Nix installations. It runs build tasks and other operations on the Nix store on behalf of non-root users. Usually you don't run the daemon directly; instead it's managed by a service management framework such as systemd on Linux, or launchctl on Darwin. Note that this daemon does not fork into the background.

## Options

--default-trust Use Nix's default trust. --force-trusted Force the daemon to trust connecting clients. --force-untrusted Force the daemon to not trust connecting clients. The connection will be processed by the receiving daemon before forwarding commands. --process-ops Forces the daemon to process received commands itself rather than forwarding the commands straight to the remote store. This is useful for the `mounted-ssh://` store where some actions need to be performed on the remote end but as connected user, and not as the user of the underlying daemon on the remote end. --stdio Attach to standard I/O, instead of trying to bind to a UNIX socket.

### Logging-related options

--debug Set the logging verbosity level to 'debug'. --log-format format Set the format of log output; one of raw, internal-json, bar or bar-with-logs. --print-build-logs / -L Print full build logs on standard error. --quiet Decrease the logging verbosity level. --verbose / -v Increase the logging verbosity level.

### Miscellaneous global options

--help Show usage information. --offline Disable substituters and consider all previously downloaded files up-to-date. --option name value Set the Nix configuration setting name to value (overriding nix.conf). --refresh Consider all previously downloaded files out-of-date. --version Show version information. Note See man nix.conf for overriding configuration settings with command line flags.
