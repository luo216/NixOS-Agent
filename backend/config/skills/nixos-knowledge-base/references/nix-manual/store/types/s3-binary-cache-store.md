## S3 Binary Cache Store

Store URL format: s3://bucket-name This store allows reading and writing a binary cache stored in an AWS S3 (or S3-compatible service) bucket. This store shares many idioms with the HTTP Binary Cache Store. For AWS S3, the binary cache URL for a bucket named example-nix-cache will be exactly s3://example-nix-cache. For S3 compatible binary caches, consult that cache's documentation.

#### Anonymous reads to your S3-compatible binary cache

If your binary cache is publicly accessible and does not require authentication, it is simplest to use the [HTTP Binary Cache Store] rather than S3 Binary Cache Store with https://example-nix-cache.s3.amazonaws.com instead of s3://example-nix-cache. Your bucket will need a bucket policy like the following to be accessible: { "Id": "DirectReads", "Version": "2012-10-17", "Statement": [ { "Sid": "AllowDirectReads", "Action": [ "s3:GetObject", "s3:GetBucketLocation" ], "Effect": "Allow", "Resource": [ "arn:aws:s3:::example-nix-cache", "arn:aws:s3:::example-nix-cache/*" ], "Principal": "*" } ] }

#### Authentication

Nix will use the default credential provider chain for authenticating requests to Amazon S3. Note that this means Nix will read environment variables and files with different idioms than with Nix's own settings, as implemented by the AWS SDK. Consult the documentation linked above for further details.

#### Authenticated reads to your S3 binary cache

Your bucket will need a bucket policy allowing the desired users to perform the s3:GetObject and s3:GetBucketLocation action on all objects in the bucket. The anonymous policy given above can be updated to have a restricted Principal to support this.

#### Authenticated writes to your S3-compatible binary cache

Your account will need an IAM policy to support uploading to the bucket: { "Version": "2012-10-17", "Statement": [ { "Sid": "UploadToCache", "Effect": "Allow", "Action": [ "s3:AbortMultipartUpload", "s3:GetBucketLocation", "s3:GetObject", "s3:ListBucket", "s3:ListBucketMultipartUploads", "s3:ListMultipartUploadParts", "s3:PutObject" ], "Resource": [ "arn:aws:s3:::example-nix-cache", "arn:aws:s3:::example-nix-cache/*" ] } ] }

#### Examples

With bucket policies and authentication set up as described above, uploading works via nix copy (experimental). To upload with a specific credential profile for Amazon S3: $ nix copy nixpkgs.hello \ --to 's3://example-nix-cache?profile=cache-upload®ion=eu-west-2' To upload to an S3-compatible binary cache: $ nix copy nixpkgs.hello --to \ 's3://example-nix-cache?profile=cache-upload&scheme=https&endpoint=minio.example.com'

### Settings

buffer-size Size (in bytes) of each part in multi-part uploads. Default: 5242880 compression NAR compression method (xz, bzip2, gzip, zstd, or none). Default: xz compression-level The preset level to be used when compressing NARs. The meaning and accepted values depend on the compression method selected. -1 specifies that the default compression level should be used. Default: -1 endpoint The URL of the endpoint of an S3-compatible service such as MinIO. Do not specify this setting if you're using Amazon S3. Note This endpoint must support HTTPS and will use path-based addressing instead of virtual host based addressing. Default: empty index-debug-info Whether to index DWARF debug info files by build ID. This allows dwarffs to fetch debug info on demand Default: false local-nar-cache Path to a local cache of NARs fetched from this binary cache, used by commands such as nix store cat. Default: empty log-compression Compression method for log/* files. It is recommended to use a compression method supported by most web browsers (e.g. brotli). Default: empty ls-compression Compression method for .ls files. Default: empty multipart-upload Whether to use multi-part uploads. Default: false narinfo-compression Compression method for .narinfo files. Default: empty parallel-compression Enable multi-threaded compression of NARs. This is currently only available for xz and zstd. Default: false path-info-cache-size Size of the in-memory store path metadata cache. Default: 65536 priority Priority of this store when used as a substituter. A lower value means a higher priority. Default: 0 profile The name of the AWS configuration profile to use. By default Nix will use the default profile. Default: empty region The region of the S3 bucket. If your bucket is not in us–east-1, you should always explicitly specify the region parameter. Default: us-east-1 scheme The scheme used for S3 requests, https (default) or http. This option allows you to disable HTTPS for binary caches which don't support it. Note HTTPS should be used if the cache might contain sensitive information. Default: empty secret-key Path to the secret key used to sign the binary cache. Default: empty store Logical location of the Nix store, usually /nix/store. Note that you can only copy store paths between stores if they have the same store setting. Default: /nix/store system-features Optional system features available on the system this store uses to build derivations. Example: "kvm" Default: machine-specific trusted Whether paths from this store can be used as substitutes even if they are not signed by a key listed in the trusted-public-keys setting. Default: false want-mass-query Whether this store can be queried efficiently for path validity when used as a substituter. Default: false write-nar-listing Whether to write a JSON file that lists the files in each NAR. Default: false
